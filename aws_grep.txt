# Finding hard-coded credentials in your code
# Hopefully you’re excited about deploying credentials to EC2 that are automatically rotated.
# Now that you’re using Roles, a good security practice would be to go through your code and remove any references to AKID/Secret.
# We suggest running the following regular expressions against your code base:
# 
# Search for access key IDs: (?<![A-Z0-9])[A-Z0-9]{20}(?![A-Z0-9]).
# In English, this regular expression says: Find me 20-character, uppercase, alphanumeric strings that don’t have any uppercase, alphanumeric characters immediately before or after.
# Search for secret access keys: (?<![A-Za-z0-9/+=])[A-Za-z0-9/+=]{40}(?![A-Za-z0-9/+=]).
# In English, this regular expression says: Find me 40-character, base-64 strings that don’t have any base 64 characters immediately before or after.
# If grep is your preferred tool, run a recursive, Perl-compatible search using the following commands:

# grep -RP '(?<![A-Z0-9])[A-Z0-9]{20}(?![A-Z0-9])' *
# grep -RP '(?<![A-Za-z0-9/+=])[A-Za-z0-9/+=]{40}(?![A-Za-z0-9/+=])' *

grep -E '[A-Z0-9]{20}' *
grep -E '[A-Za-z0-9/+=]{40}' *
